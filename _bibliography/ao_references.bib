abstract = {In this chapter we do not present one specific algorithm; instead we try to describe the approaches the German company named Crytek took to find certain rendering algorithms that work well together. We believe this information is valuable for anyone that wants to implement similar rendering algorithms because often the implementation challenges arise when combining with other algorithms. We will also describe briefly the path to it as that covers alternative approaches you also might want to consider. This is not a complete description of everything that was done on the rendering side because for this chapter we picked certain areas that are of interest specifically for this audience and limited ourselves to a presentable extend.The work presented here takes significant advantage of research done by the graphics community in recent years and combines it with novel ideas developed within Crytek to realize implementations that efficiently map onto graphics hardware.},
