<!-- abstract --> My path to learn CGI.

My interest in CGI started when I was around 14 years old. My generation lived during the ``raising of youtube and social media content``. One of those days, people like CaptainSparklez and other content creators published videos like 
["Revenge" - A Minecraft Parody of Usher's DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love (Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPJUBQd-PNM) where they remix a song with a ``minecraft animation following the history``.

One day I stept upon a video called  [Stick With Me - Minecraft Animation - Slamacow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGz7ltTqEfk) and the idea of creating a transparent creature that behaves like a soft body fascinated me to the point that ``I wanted to try by myself``. I started with Autodesk Maya for a few days without much success. On a second try I discovered that those kind of animatins where made with Cinema4D but it was not for me, it felt cumbersom and I lacked the neccessary background knowledge. A few months later I was told that there whas this free prgram that was grwing really fast.

``Blender`` was a game changer for me. I was able to understand the interface pretty quick and not only that but I found on internet a guru, Blender Guru. ``Andrew Price`` teachd me for years. I spent my following years recreating tutorials and studiyng the basics of CGI.
