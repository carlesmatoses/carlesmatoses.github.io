# My history
My interest in CGI started when I was around 14 years old. My generation lived during the ``raising of youtube and social media content``. 

One of those days, content creators published videos like 
["Revenge" - A Minecraft Parody of Usher's DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love (Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPJUBQd-PNM) where they remixed songs with`` Minecraft animations following the storyline``.

I stumbled upon a video called  [Stick With Me - Minecraft Animation - Slamacow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGz7ltTqEfk) and the idea of creating a transparent creature that behaves like a soft body fascinated me to the point that ``I wanted to try by myself``.

I started with Autodesk Maya for a few days without much success. 

On a second try I discovered Cinema4D, it felt cumbersom and I lacked the neccessary background knowledge. 

A few months later I was told there was a free prgram that was growing really fast.

``Blender`` was a game changer for me. I was able to understand the interface pretty quick and not only that but I found a Blender Guru. ``Andrew Price`` teachd me all the basics. 

I spent my following years recreating tutorials and studiyng the bases of CGI.

Remember that those are tutorials, not my level at the time. 

After all that experience ``I decided to just learn more`` without actually making projects. 

I don't have many pictures of this period but here are some:

I still don't make many projects in blender but I like to learn from it and use the tool for different projects.
